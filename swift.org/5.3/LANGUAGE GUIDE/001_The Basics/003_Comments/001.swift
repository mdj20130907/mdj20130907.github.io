// Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):

// Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and,
// end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/):
print("hello"/*打印*/)

// multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments

/* 外层注释
    /* 内层注释 */
这里也是注释*/

// Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily,
// even if the code already contains multiline comments.
