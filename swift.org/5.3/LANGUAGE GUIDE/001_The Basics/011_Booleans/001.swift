// Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool.
// Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.
// Swift provides two Boolean constant values, `true` and `false`

let a = true, b = false
// Boolean literal values


let i = 1
// if i {}
// error: type 'Int' cannot be used as a boolean; test for '!= 0' instead
// Swiftâ€™s type safety prevents non-Boolean values from being substituted for Bool.
