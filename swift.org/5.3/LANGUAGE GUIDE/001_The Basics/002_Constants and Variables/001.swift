// You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:
var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0

// If a stored value in your code won’t change, always declare it as a constant with the let keyword.
// Use variables only for storing values that need to be able to change.

// type annotation
// The colon in the declaration means “…of type…”
var welcomeMessage: String
welcomeMessage = "hello"

// You can define multiple related variables of the same type on a single line,
// separated by commas, with a single type annotation after the final variable name
var red, green, blue: Double

// It’s rare that you need to write type annotations in practice.
// infer the type
