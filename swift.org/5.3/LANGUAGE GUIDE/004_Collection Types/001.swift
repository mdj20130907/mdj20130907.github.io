// Swift provides three primary collection types,
// known as `arrays`, `sets`, and `dictionaries`, for storing collections of values.

// Arrays are ordered collections of values.

// Sets are unordered collections of unique values.

// Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

// Swiftâ€™s array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections.
