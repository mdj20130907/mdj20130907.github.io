// Logical NOT (!a)
// is a prefix operator,
// and appears immediately before the value it operates on, without any white space

// Logical AND (a && b)
// short-circuit evaluation

// Logical OR (a || b)
// short-circuit evaluation

// Combining Logical Operators
// The Swift logical operators && and || are left-associative,
// meaning that compound expressions with multiple logical operators evaluate the leftmost subexpression first.

// Explicit Parentheses
// Readability is always preferred over brevity;
// use parentheses where they help to make your intentions clear.
