// When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage,
// the Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms.

// Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units.

// These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a string as 32-bit code units).
