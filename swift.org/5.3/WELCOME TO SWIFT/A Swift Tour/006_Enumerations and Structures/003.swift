// If an enumeration has raw values, those values are determined as part of the declaration, which means every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value.
// Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values associated with the caseâ€”these values are determined when you make the instance, and they can be different for each instance of an enumeration case.
// You can think of the associated values as behaving like stored properties of the enumeration case instance.

// Notice how the sunrise and sunset times are extracted from the ServerResponse value as part of matching the value against the switch cases.
