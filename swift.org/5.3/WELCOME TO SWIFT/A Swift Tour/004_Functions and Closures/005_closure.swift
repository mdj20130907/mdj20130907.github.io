// Functions are actually a special case of closures:
// blocks of code that can be called later.
// The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created,
// even if the closure is in a different scope when it is executed
// â€”you saw an example of this already with nested functions.
// You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces ({}).
// Use in to separate the arguments and return type from the body.
